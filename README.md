This repository demonstrates a common React bug involving the incorrect use of lifecycle methods for updating component state. The `BuggyComponent.js` file showcases the outdated `componentWillReceiveProps` method, while `FixedComponent.js` presents the correct implementation using `getDerivedStateFromProps` and the `useEffect` hook. This example highlights the importance of using modern React lifecycle methods for maintainability and compatibility with recent React versions.
